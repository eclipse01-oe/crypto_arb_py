        # 1. Fetch available USDT balance on buy_exchange.
        # 2. Fetch available crypto balance (e.g., BTC) on sell_exchange (if pre-funded).
        # 3. Check order book depth on both exchanges to determine max executable amount without high slippage.
        # 4. Use MIN_TRADE_AMOUNT_USDT and MAX_TRADE_AMOUNT_USDT from config.
        
        # Example: Let's assume we want to trade a fixed USDT amount for simulation
        trade_amount_usdt = min(MAX_TRADE_AMOUNT, max(MIN_TRADE_AMOUNT, 100)) # Example: $100
